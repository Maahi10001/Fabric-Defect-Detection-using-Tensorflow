# Fabric-Defect-Detection-using-Tensorflow

fabric defect detection is a critical step in ensuring the quality of fabrics produced. The traditional method of fabric inspection is manual, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. With the advancements in computer vision and deep learning, automated fabric defect detection has become possible. In this project, we propose a system for fabric defect detection using the Inception V3 model.
